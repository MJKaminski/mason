I've modified the format as follows.  There is only ONE master file for the time being (this might be a mistake), and no subfiles.

The master file has the following format:

Ind val 1, Int val 2, ..., Dep val 1 last, Dep val 1 min, Dep val 1 avg, Dep val 1 max, Dep val 2 last, Dep val 2 min, ..., STEPS....

Where STEPS are, for each step, the values of the dependent variables that are participating in the N steps thingamajigger

Various items may be omitted: we also need a header
